# master-weather-model-list

This repository is a **simple, human-readable catalog of publicly available weather forecast models**.

It focuses on **numerical weather prediction (NWP) models** whose forecast data can be **freely downloaded** by anyone.

The goal is to make it easy to discover:
- which weather models exist
- who produces them
- what regions they cover
- and where their data can be downloaded

No meteorology background is required to use this repository.
