# master-weather-model-list

This repository is a **simple, human-readable catalog of publicly available forecast models**.

It focuses on **numerical weather prediction (NWP)** and related forecast systems whose data can be **freely downloaded** by anyone.

The goal is to make it easy to discover:
- which forecast models exist
- who produces them
- what regions they cover
- and where their data can be downloaded

No meteorology background is required to use this repository.

## What this repository includes
- **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models** (deterministic)
- **Ensemble forecast models** (global and regional)
- **Wave forecast models**
- **Tropical cyclone / hurricane models**
- **Free and publicly downloadable data**
- Models provided by government or publicly funded institutions
- **Global**, **regional**, **coastal**, and **storm-centered** forecast systems

---

## What this repository does NOT include
- Paid, restricted, or licensed-only models
- Models that only provide maps or viewers without downloadable data
- Research-only, experimental, or one-off model runs
- Climate reanalysis or historical-only datasets
- Air-quality, chemistry, or ocean circulation models (for now)

---

## Repository structure

Models are organized by:
- **Model type** (weather, ensemble, wave, tropical cyclone)
- **Geographic scope** (global vs regional)
- **Country or organization of origin**

Each model has its own file describing:
- what the model is
- who runs it
- what area it covers
- basic resolution and update information
- where to download the data

---

## Why this exists

Information about forecast models is often:
- scattered across many websites
- written for experts only
- difficult to compare or discover

This repository aims to provide a **clear, neutral, and beginner-friendly index** of what is publicly available.
