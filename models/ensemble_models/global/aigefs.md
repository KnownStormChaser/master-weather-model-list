# AIGEFS (AI-based Global Ensemble Forecast System)

## What this model is
AIGEFS is an **AI-based global ensemble weather forecast system** developed as an experimental companion to the traditional GEFS.

It uses machine-learning techniques trained on historical numerical weather prediction data to generate ensemble forecasts more efficiently than physics-based ensemble models.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : National Centers for Environmental Prediction
- **Country / region:** United States

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Global ensemble (AI-based atmospheric model)
- **Number of members:** Similar to GEFS (control + perturbed members)
- **Typical resolution:** ~0.25°
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~16 days
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - temperature
  - wind
  - precipitation
  - pressure
- Ensemble mean and spread
- AI-generated alternatives to traditional ensemble forecasts

---

## Relationship to other models
AIGEFS is an **AI-based counterpart to GEFS**.  
It is designed to approximate the behavior of the traditional GEFS ensemble while reducing computational cost.

It does **not** replace GEFS and should be considered experimental or pre-operational.

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2
- **Official download locations:**

---

## Notes
AIGEFS is intended for research, evaluation, and early operational testing.

While the data is publicly available, users should treat it as **experimental guidance** rather than a fully operational forecast system.
