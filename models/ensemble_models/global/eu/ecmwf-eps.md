# ECMWF EPS (Ensemble Prediction System)

## What this model is
The ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) is a **global ensemble weather forecast system** designed to quantify uncertainty in medium-range weather forecasts.

It produces multiple forecasts from slightly different initial conditions to represent a range of possible atmospheric outcomes.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
- **Country / region:** International (European consortium)

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Global ensemble (atmospheric)
- **Number of members:** 50 perturbation members + 1 control  
- **Typical resolution:** ~0.5° (Open Data subset)
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~15 days
- **Update frequency:** 2× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - temperature
  - wind
  - precipitation
  - pressure
- Ensemble mean and spread
- Inputs for risk-based and probabilistic forecasting

---

## Relationship to other models
ECMWF EPS is the ensemble companion to the **IFS** deterministic global model.

The Open Data version provides a reduced-resolution and reduced-field subset of the full operational EPS.

---

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes (Open Data subset)
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2
- **Official download locations:**

## Notes
ECMWF EPS is widely regarded as one of the highest-skill global ensemble forecast systems.

Users should note that the freely available Open Data represents a subset of the full operational EPS.
