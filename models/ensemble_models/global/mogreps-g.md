# MOGREPS-G (Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System – Global)

## What this model is
MOGREPS-G is the **global ensemble weather forecast system** operated by the UK Met Office. It produces multiple forecasts to represent uncertainty in medium-range weather predictions.

Instead of a single deterministic forecast, MOGREPS-G generates an ensemble of plausible future atmospheric states.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : Met Office
- **Country / region:** United Kingdom

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Global ensemble (atmospheric)
- **Number of members:** 17 perturbation members + 1 control
- **Typical resolution:** ~0.83° × 0.56° (Open Data subset; varies by forecast range)
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~8 days
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - temperature
  - wind
  - precipitation
  - pressure
- Ensemble mean and spread
- Uncertainty guidance for medium-range forecasting

---

## Relationship to other models
MOGREPS-G is the ensemble companion to the UK Met Office’s **Global Deterministic Model (UKMO Global)**.

The openly available data represents a **subset** of the full operational ensemble.

## Notes
MOGREPS-G is used operationally by the UK Met Office to assess forecast uncertainty and supports probabilistic decision-making.

Users should note that only a reduced subset of parameters and resolution is publicly available.
