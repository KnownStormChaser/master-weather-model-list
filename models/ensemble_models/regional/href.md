# HREF (High-Resolution Ensemble Forecast)

## What this model is
The High-Resolution Ensemble Forecast (HREF) is a **regional, convection-allowing ensemble weather forecast system** designed to capture uncertainty in short-range, high-impact weather such as thunderstorms, heavy rainfall, and severe weather.

HREF combines forecasts from multiple high-resolution numerical weather models to produce probabilistic guidance at convection-resolving scales.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : National Centers for Environmental Prediction
- **Country / region:** United States

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Continental United States (CONUS)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional ensemble (convection-allowing)
- **Number of members:** Varies by cycle (typically 8–10 members)
- **Typical resolution:** ~3 km
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~48 hours
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - precipitation
  - severe convection indicators
  - temperature
  - wind
- Ensemble mean and spread
- Neighborhood probabilities for high-impact weather

---

## Relationship to other models
HREF is a **multi-model regional ensemble**, combining members from several high-resolution deterministic models (such as HRRR, NAM Nest, and FV3-based regional models).

It complements single-model high-resolution forecasts by explicitly representing short-range forecast uncertainty.

## Notes
HREF is optimized for short-range forecasting and severe weather applications.

Because it blends multiple high-resolution models, the exact member composition may evolve over time.
