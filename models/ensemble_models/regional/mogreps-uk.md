# MOGREPS-UK (Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System – UK)

## What this model is
MOGREPS-UK is a **high-resolution regional ensemble weather forecast system** operated by the UK Met Office.

It is designed to represent forecast uncertainty for short-range, high-impact weather over the United Kingdom, including convection, heavy rainfall, wind, and temperature extremes.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : Met Office
- **Country / region:** United Kingdom

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** United Kingdom and nearby surrounding regions

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional ensemble (convection-allowing)
- **Number of members:** 17 perturbation members + 1 control
- **Typical resolution:** ~2.2 km
- **Forecast length:** Up to 5 days
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - precipitation
  - wind
  - temperature
  - convection-related hazards
- Ensemble mean and spread
- Short-range uncertainty guidance for high-impact weather

---

## Relationship to other models
MOGREPS-UK is the **regional, convection-permitting counterpart** to **MOGREPS-G**, the UK Met Office global ensemble system.

It complements the UK Met Office’s deterministic high-resolution UK model by providing probabilistic guidance at local scales.

## Notes
MOGREPS-UK is optimized for short-range forecasting over the UK and is particularly valuable for assessing uncertainty in convective and high-impact weather events.

Only a subset of the full operational ensemble is publicly available.
