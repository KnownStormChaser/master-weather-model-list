# REPS (Regional Ensemble Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS) is Canada’s **regional ensemble weather forecast system**, designed to quantify forecast uncertainty at regional scales.

REPS produces multiple forecasts with perturbed initial conditions to provide probabilistic guidance for short- to medium-range weather forecasting over Canada.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : Environment and Climate Change Canada
- **Country / region:** Canada

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Canada and surrounding regions

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional ensemble (atmospheric)
- **Number of members:** 20 perturbation members + 1 control
- **Typical resolution:** ~10 km
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~72 hours
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## What it provides
- Probabilistic forecasts for:
  - temperature
  - wind
  - precipitation
  - pressure
- Ensemble mean and spread
- Regional uncertainty guidance for weather-sensitive decision making

---

## Relationship to other models
REPS is the ensemble companion to Canada’s **RDPS** deterministic regional model.

It complements both RDPS and **GEPS** by providing probabilistic guidance at regional scales.

## Notes
REPS is used operationally by Environment and Climate Change Canada for regional probabilistic forecasting.

As with all ensemble systems, REPS outputs should be interpreted probabilistically rather than as deterministic forecasts.
