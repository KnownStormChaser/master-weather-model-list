# REPS (Regional Ensemble Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS) is Canada’s short-range regional ensemble numerical weather prediction system, designed to provide probabilistic guidance and quantify forecast uncertainty at regional scales.

REPS complements Canada’s deterministic regional guidance by explicitly representing uncertainty in short-range forecasts over North America.

  Rotated regional grid covering Canada, the United States, and adjacent oceans

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional ensemble NWP
- **Model system / core:** GEM
- **Number of members:** 20 perturbed members + 1 control
- **Horizontal resolution:**  
  ~10 km
- **Vertical levels:** ~84 hybrid levels with lid nesting
- **Model top:** ~17 hPa
- **Forecast length:**  
  Up to ~72 hours
- **Update frequency / cycles:**  
  4× daily (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC)
- **Temporal output resolution:**  
  Typically hourly to 3-hourly

## Ensemble methodology
REPS does not include a standalone data assimilation system.

Instead, ensemble members are generated by:
- Recentering perturbations derived from the GEPS ensemble around the GDPS deterministic analysis
- Applying homogeneous isentropic perturbations (HIP) to upper-air initial conditions
- Using stochastic perturbation of physics parameters (SPP) during model integration
- Driving the model with boundary conditions from GEPS ensemble members

This approach ensures consistency with Canada’s global deterministic and ensemble systems while representing regional-scale uncertainty.

## What it provides
Probabilistic short-range forecasts of:
- Temperature, wind, humidity, and pressure
- Precipitation amount and type
- Cloud cover and near-surface conditions
- Ensemble mean, spread, and probability-based guidance

REPS provides the primary regional-scale probabilistic guidance for forecast days 1–3 in Canada.

---

## Relationship to other models
- REPS is the ensemble counterpart to Canada’s **RDPS** deterministic regional guidance.
- It bridges global ensemble uncertainty from **GEPS** to regional forecasting needs.
- REPS complements both deterministic and global ensemble products by focusing on short-range regional uncertainty.

## Notes
- REPS operates using a hydrostatic limited-area GEM configuration with lid nesting.
- Stochastic physics perturbations are active; stochastic kinetic energy backscatter (SKEB) is not used.
- As with all ensemble systems, REPS output should be interpreted probabilistically rather than deterministically.
