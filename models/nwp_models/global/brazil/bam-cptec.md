# BAM (Brazilian Atmospheric Model)

## What this model is
The Brazilian Atmospheric Model (BAM) is a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model developed and operated by CPTEC/INPE for medium-range weather forecasting.

BAM provides deterministic global forecasts and is part of Brazil’s national operational weather prediction suite.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** CPTEC/INPE (Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies / National Institute for Space Research)
- **Country / region:** Brazil

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Deterministic global NWP
- **Horizontal resolution:**  
  ~20 km
- **Forecast length:**  
  Up to ~7 days
- **Update frequency / cycles:**  
  1× daily (00 UTC)
- **Temporal output resolution:**  
  Model-dependent (varies by forecast lead time)

---

## What it provides
Deterministic global forecasts of core atmospheric variables, including:
- Temperature
- Wind
- Atmospheric pressure
- Humidity
- Precipitation

BAM output is used for medium-range forecasting and as background guidance within CPTEC’s operational workflow.
