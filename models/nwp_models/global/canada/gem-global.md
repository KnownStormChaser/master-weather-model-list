# GDPS (Global Deterministic Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) is a **coupled deterministic numerical weather prediction system** operated by Canada.

It combines the **GEM atmospheric model** with **NEMO–CICE ocean and sea ice models** to produce global forecasts of atmospheric and surface conditions.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** Canadian Meteorological Centre / Environment and Climate Change Canada
- **Country / region:** Canada

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Global

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Deterministic (global, coupled atmosphere–ocean–ice)
- **Typical resolution:** ~15 km
- **Vertical levels:** ~30
- **Forecast length:** Up to 10 days
- **Update frequency:** 2× daily

---

## Relationship to other models
GDPS is Canada’s primary **global deterministic forecast system**.

The **Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS)** is now produced as a **regional-domain component of GDPS** at ~10 km resolution over North America.

## Notes
Variable availability and output frequency depend on forecast lead time.

GDPS provides the large-scale deterministic guidance that underpins Canada’s regional and ensemble prediction systems.
