# AIGFS (AI Global Forecast System)

## What this model is
AIGFS is an experimental global weather forecast model that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict weather conditions such as temperature, wind, pressure, and precipitation.

Unlike traditional numerical weather prediction models, AIGFS is trained on historical weather data rather than solving physical equations directly.

## Notes
AIGFS is an experimental system and is not a replacement for the operational GFS.

It is primarily intended for research, evaluation, and comparison with traditional physics-based models.

Forecast skill and available variables may change as the system evolves.
