# AIGFS (AI Global Forecast System)

## What this model is
The AI Global Forecast System (AIGFS) is an experimental global weather forecasting model developed by NOAA that uses machine learning to emulate the forecast behavior of the Global Forecast System (GFS).

AIGFS is based on the GraphCast architecture and is trained using a combination of NOAA Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) analyses, operational GFS data, and selected ECMWF reanalysis and analysis datasets. Unlike traditional numerical weather prediction models, AIGFS does not explicitly solve physical equations, but instead learns forecast evolution directly from historical atmospheric states.

## What it provides
Deterministic global forecasts of key atmospheric and surface variables, including:
- Temperature
- Wind

## Notes
- AIGFS is an experimental system and is not a replacement for the operational GFS.
- The model runs extremely efficiently, producing multi-day global forecasts in minutes using GPU hardware.
- Forecast skill, configuration, and available variables may evolve as NOAA continues development and evaluation.
- AIGFS does not perform data assimilation; it relies on analyzed initial conditions generated by traditional NWP systems.
