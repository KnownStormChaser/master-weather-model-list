# OpenSkiron (SKIRON Regional Forecast System)

## What this model is
OpenSkiron is a regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasting system that provides deterministic GRIB forecast products for the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and surrounding regions.

The OpenSkiron GRIB files are produced using the **SKIRON atmospheric model**, a regional forecasting system with roots in the ETA model lineage, and are made publicly available through the OpenSkiron platform.

---

## Scientific origin
The SKIRON model is developed and maintained by the:

- **National and Kapodistrian University of Athens**  
  School of Physics  
  Division of Physics of Environment – Meteorology  
  Atmospheric Modeling and Weather Forecasting Group

OpenSkiron redistributes forecast outputs generated using this academic modeling system.

---

## Who operates the distribution
- **Operator:** Independent individual (OpenSkiron.org)
- **Country / region:** Greece / Europe

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Regional domains covering the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and adjacent land areas
- **Example domains:**  
  Western Mediterranean, Adriatic, Ionian, Aegean, Black Sea (east and west), Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, Balearic Islands, Tunisia, Iberian Peninsula coastal regions

Domains are operated independently and may overlap to provide focused regional guidance.

---

## Model configuration
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic NWP
- **Model system:** SKIRON (ETA-based)
- **Hydrostatic / non-hydrostatic:** Hydrostatic
- **Initialization:**  
  Global atmospheric analysis data
- **Boundary conditions:**  
  Global forecast model forcing

(The exact source and resolution of global forcing may vary by production cycle.)

---

## What it provides
The OpenSkiron GRIB products include the following forecast fields:

- 10 m wind (speed and direction)
- Mean sea level pressure
- Accumulated precipitation
- Total cloud coverage
- Relative humidity
- Surface temperature

These fields are primarily intended for **synoptic and regional-scale weather guidance**, particularly over marine and coastal regions.

---

## Update frequency
- **Nominal production:** Regular operational runs
- **Run timing:** Varies by domain and data availability

---

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB
- **Official access point:**

## Notes
- OpenSkiron provides regional deterministic guidance rather than ensemble or probabilistic forecasts.
- The SKIRON model is widely used in research and operational contexts for Mediterranean weather forecasting.
- OpenSkiron GRIBs complement higher-resolution systems such as OpenWRF by providing broader regional context.
