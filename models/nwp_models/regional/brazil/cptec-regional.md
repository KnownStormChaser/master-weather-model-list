# CPTEC/INPE Regional Model (7 km)

## What this model is
A high-resolution regional numerical weather prediction model operated by CPTEC/INPE to forecast weather conditions such as temperature, wind, precipitation, and pressure over Brazil and surrounding areas.

The model is designed for short-range forecasting and provides more local detail than global models used operationally by CPTEC.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** CPTEC/INPE (Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies / National Institute for Space Research)
- **Country / region:** Brazil

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Brazil and surrounding regions

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic NWP
- **Horizontal resolution:**  
  ~7 km
- **Forecast length:**  
  Up to ~72 hours
- **Update frequency / cycles:**  
  2× daily

---

## What it provides
Deterministic regional forecasts of:
- Near-surface temperature, wind, and humidity
- Precipitation
- Atmospheric pressure and circulation fields

The model is used to support national short-range weather forecasting over Brazil.

## Notes
- CPTEC operates a single regional configuration at approximately 7 km horizontal resolution.
- Earlier higher-resolution experimental configurations are no longer operational.
- Output availability and variables depend on the operational cycle.
