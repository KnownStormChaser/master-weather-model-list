# HRDPS (High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System)

## What this model is
The High-Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) is a **convection-allowing deterministic numerical weather prediction system** designed to forecast small-scale and rapidly evolving weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, localized wind patterns, and heavy precipitation.

It produces raw numerical forecasts of atmospheric elements including temperature, wind, precipitation, cloud cover, and humidity.

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** Environment and Climate Change Canada
- **Country / region:** Canada

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Most of Canada (high-resolution regional domains)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Deterministic (high-resolution regional)
- **Typical resolution:** ~2.5 km
- **Vertical levels:** ~31
- **Forecast length:** Up to 48 hours
- **Update frequency:** Up to 4× daily

---

## Relationship to other models
HRDPS is Canada’s **highest-resolution operational deterministic weather model**.

It complements **RDPS** and **GDPS** by providing convection-permitting guidance at local scales.

## Notes
HRDPS provides convection-allowing forecasts similar in purpose to the US **HRRR**, but with a longer forecast range and less frequent update cycles.
