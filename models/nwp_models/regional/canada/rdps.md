# RDPS (Regional Deterministic Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS) is a **deterministic numerical weather prediction system** used to forecast atmospheric conditions such as temperature, wind, precipitation, cloud cover, and humidity.

It provides higher-resolution short- to medium-range forecasts over North America.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** Environment and Climate Change Canada
- **Country / region:** Canada

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Canada and the United States (North American domain)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Deterministic (regional-domain configuration)
- **Typical resolution:** ~10 km
- **Vertical levels:** ~33
- **Forecast length:** Up to 84 hours
- **Update frequency:** 4× daily

---

## Relationship to other models
RDPS is now produced as a **regional-domain component of Canada’s Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS)** at 10 km resolution, focused on North America.

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2

---

## Notes
RDPS serves a similar operational role to the **NAM** in the United States, providing higher-resolution deterministic guidance than global models for short-range forecasting.
