# ICON-D2 (DWD convection-permitting regional model)

## What this model is
ICON-D2 is DWD’s **convection-permitting** (high-resolution) regional NWP configuration of ICON.

It is designed for short-range forecasting of small-scale, high-impact weather such as convective precipitation, strong winds, and fog.

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic (convection-permitting)
- **Native grid:** triangular, ~2.1 km average grid spacing
- **Also provided on:** rotated lat/lon grid at 0.02° (same spacing as former COSMO-D2 lat/lon output)
- **Update frequency:** new forecasts every 3 hours
- **Forecast length:** up to 48 hours
- **Operational note:** ICON-D2 replaced COSMO-D2 on 2021-02-10

## What it provides
- High-resolution deterministic forecasts of:
  - temperature
  - wind
  - precipitation
  - humidity
  - pressure
  - cloud/hydrometeor fields

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes (subset via Open Data)
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
