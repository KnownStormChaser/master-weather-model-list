# AROME Hungary

## What this model is
AROME Hungary is a **high-resolution, convection-permitting regional deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by HungaroMet.

It is designed for **short-range forecasting and nowcasting**, particularly for convective weather, heavy precipitation, and rapidly evolving weather events over Hungary and surrounding regions.
