# HARMONIE-AROME Ireland

## What this model is
HARMONIE-AROME Ireland is a **high-resolution, convection-permitting regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by Met Éireann.

It is designed to forecast small-scale and rapidly evolving weather phenomena such as showers, thunderstorms, local wind patterns, and fog.

## Notes
Met Éireann operates HARMONIE-AROME primarily as part of its **ensemble system**, known as **IREPS (Irish Regional Ensemble Prediction System)**.

This entry describes the **deterministic HARMONIE-AROME configuration**; IREPS should be documented separately under regional ensemble models.
