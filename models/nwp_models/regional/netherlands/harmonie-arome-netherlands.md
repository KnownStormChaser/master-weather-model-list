# HARMONIE-AROME Netherlands (KNMI)

## What this model is
HARMONIE-AROME Netherlands is a **high-resolution regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).

It is based on the **HARMONIE modeling system (Cycle 43)** and is optimized for short-range forecasting of small-scale and rapidly evolving weather phenomena such as showers, thunderstorms, fog, and local wind patterns over the Netherlands and neighboring regions.
