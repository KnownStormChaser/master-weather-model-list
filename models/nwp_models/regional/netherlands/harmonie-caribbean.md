# HARMONIE Caribbean (KNMI – Cy43 BES)

## What this model is
HARMONIE Caribbean is a **regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for the Caribbean region.

It is based on the **HARMONIE modeling system (Cycle 43)** and is designed for forecasting tropical and subtropical weather affecting the Dutch Caribbean and surrounding areas.
