# HARMONIE Europe (KNMI – DINI)

## What this model is
HARMONIE Europe is a **regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for north-western Europe.

It is based on the **HARMONIE modeling system (Cycle 43)** and provides medium-resolution deterministic forecasts over a large European domain.
