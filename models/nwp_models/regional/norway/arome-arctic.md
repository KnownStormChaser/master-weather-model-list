# AROME-Arctic

## What this model is
AROME-Arctic is a **high-resolution, convection-permitting regional deterministic numerical weather prediction (NWP) model** operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway).

It is specifically designed for **high-latitude and polar environments**, with improved representation of Arctic boundary layers, sea ice interaction, and mesoscale weather systems such as polar lows.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway)
- **Country / region:** Norway

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Arctic regions, including Svalbard, surrounding Arctic Ocean areas, the Barents Sea, and nearby land and marine regions

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic NWP (convection-permitting)
- **Model system:** AROME
- **Horizontal resolution:** ~2.5 km
- **Vertical levels:** 65
- **Forecast length:** Up to 48 hours
- **Update frequency:** 8× daily (every 3 hours)

---

## What it provides
Deterministic high-resolution forecasts of:
- temperature
- wind
- precipitation
- pressure
- humidity
- cloud and hydrometeor fields

The model is optimized for:
- polar boundary layer processes
- sea ice and cold-surface interactions
- strong winds and polar low development

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2, NetCDF

## Notes
AROME-Arctic is a **deterministic model** and should not be confused with **MEPS**, which is an ensemble system based on HARMONIE-AROME.

It is widely used for both **operational forecasting** and **research applications** in the Arctic.
