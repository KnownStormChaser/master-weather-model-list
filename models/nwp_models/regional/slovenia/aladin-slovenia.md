## Notes
This entry describes the **ALADIN regional forecast model** (4 km, up to +72 h).

ARSO also provides a **separate high-resolution nowcasting product** at ~1 km resolution with very short lead times (up to +6 h); that is a different system and is not part of the ALADIN forecast model described here.
