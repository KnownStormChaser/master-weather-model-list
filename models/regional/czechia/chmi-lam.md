# CHMI LAM (CZ & Lambert Domains)

## What this model is
A regional weather forecast model that predicts weather conditions such as temperature, wind, precipitation, and pressure over Czechia and surrounding Central European regions.

It is a limited-area model based on the **ALADIN** modeling system and is designed for short-range forecasting at higher resolution than global models.

## Notes
ČHMÚ runs regional forecasts using the **ALADIN limited-area modeling system** with multiple domain configurations, commonly referred to as **CZ** and **Lambert**.

These configurations differ mainly in map projection and domain extent but are part of the same ALADIN-based forecasting system and are therefore documented together here.
