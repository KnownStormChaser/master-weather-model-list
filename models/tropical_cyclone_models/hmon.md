# HMON (Hurricane Multi-scale Ocean-coupled Non-hydrostatic Model) — Legacy

## What this model is
The Hurricane Multi-scale Ocean-coupled Non-hydrostatic (HMON) model was a **specialized tropical cyclone forecast model** used by NOAA to complement HWRF.

HMON placed additional emphasis on ocean–atmosphere coupling to better represent storm intensity changes.

---

## Who ran it
- **Organization:** : National Centers for Environmental Prediction
- **Country / region:** United States

---

## When this model ran
HMON ran **only when an active tropical cyclone existed**.

Forecasts were generated for individual storms using storm-centered moving domains.

---

## What area it covered
- **Coverage:** Storm-centered domains following active tropical cyclones  
  (Atlantic and Eastern/Central Pacific basins)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Tropical cyclone NWP model (legacy)
- **Core system:** FV3-based
- **Horizontal resolution:**  
  - Outer domain: ~13 km  
  - Inner moving nest(s): ~3 km
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~126 hours
- **Update frequency:** Every 6 hours (per active storm)

---

## What it predicted
- Tropical cyclone track
- Storm intensity (maximum winds, central pressure)
- Wind fields
- Precipitation
- Storm structure and evolution
- Ocean–atmosphere interaction effects

---

## Relationship to other models
HMON operated alongside HWRF and has also been **retired and replaced by HAFS**.

It is included here for historical completeness and comparison.

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes (historical archives)
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes

## Notes
HMON is no longer operational.  
Current tropical cyclone forecasting at NOAA is handled by **HAFS**.
