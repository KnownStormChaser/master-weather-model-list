# HWRF (Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting Model) — Legacy

## What this model is
The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model was a **specialized tropical cyclone prediction model** used operationally by NOAA for forecasting hurricane track, intensity, and structure.

It used storm-centered moving nests to provide high-resolution forecasts focused on active tropical cyclones.

---

## Who ran it
- **Organization:** : National Centers for Environmental Prediction
- **Country / region:** United States

---

## When this model ran
HWRF ran **only when an active tropical cyclone existed**.

Each forecast was centered on an individual storm rather than a fixed geographic region.

---

## What area it covered
- **Coverage:** Storm-centered domains following active tropical cyclones  
  (Atlantic and Eastern/Central Pacific basins)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Tropical cyclone NWP model (legacy)
- **Core system:** WRF-based
- **Horizontal resolution:**  
  - Outer domain: ~13 km  
  - Inner moving nest(s): ~3 km
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~126 hours
- **Update frequency:** Every 6 hours (per active storm)

---

## What it predicted
- Tropical cyclone track
- Storm intensity (maximum winds, central pressure)
- Wind fields
- Precipitation
- Storm structure and evolution

---

## Relationship to other models
HWRF was one of NOAA’s primary operational hurricane models for many years and has been **retired and replaced by HAFS**.

It is retained here for historical reference and comparison.

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes (historical archives)
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes

## Notes
HWRF is no longer operational.  
Users should rely on **HAFS** for current tropical cyclone forecasting.
