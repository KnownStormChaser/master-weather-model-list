# WAVEWATCH III (WW3) – NOAA

## What this model is
WAVEWATCH III (WW3) is a global wave forecast model that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It uses wind forecasts from atmospheric models to simulate how waves form, grow, and move across the oceans.

## Notes
WAVEWATCH III is one of the most widely used wave models in the world and serves as the foundation for many national and international wave forecasting systems.

Many weather services run their own regional wave models based on WW3.
