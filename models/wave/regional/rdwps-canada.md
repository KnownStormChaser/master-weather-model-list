# RDWPS (Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Regional Deterministic Wave Prediction System (RDWPS) is a regional wave forecast model that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It provides higher-resolution wave forecasts than Canada’s global wave model and is intended for regional marine forecasting.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** : Environment and Climate Change Canada
- **Country / region:** Canada

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Regional ocean domains surrounding Canada  
  (including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic regions)

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Wave model
- **Typical resolution:** ~0.1° (varies by region)
- **Forecast length:** Up to ~48 hours
- **Update frequency:** 2× daily

---

## What it predicts
- Significant wave height
- Wave period
- Wave direction
- Wind-wave and swell components (varies by product)

---

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2, NetCDF

## Notes
RDWPS is based on the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model and is driven by winds from Canada’s regional atmospheric forecast systems.

It provides more detailed coastal and regional wave information than the global GDWPS model.
