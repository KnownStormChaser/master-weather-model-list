# WW3-WARP (Météo-France – Atlantic)

## What this model is
WW3-WARP is a high-resolution regional wave forecast model based on **WAVEWATCH III (WW3)**. It simulates ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave direction, and wave periods over the eastern Atlantic.

This configuration is **forced by winds from the ARPEGE atmospheric model** for accurate regional sea state forecasts.
