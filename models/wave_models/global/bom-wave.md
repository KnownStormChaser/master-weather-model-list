# BoM Wave Model

## What this model is
The BoM Wave Model is an operational numerical wave forecast system that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It is Australia’s primary wave forecasting system and is especially important for the Southern Ocean, the Pacific, and tropical cyclone regions.

## Notes
The BoM Wave Model is based on the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) modeling system and is forced by winds from Australia’s operational atmospheric models.

It is widely used for marine forecasting, shipping, offshore operations, and tropical cyclone wave prediction.
