# WWATCH (CPTEC/INPE Global Wave Model)

## What this model is
WWATCH is a global ocean wave forecasting model operated by CPTEC/INPE, based on the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) modeling system.

The model provides deterministic forecasts of ocean surface wave conditions and is used to support marine and coastal weather forecasting.
