# ECMWF Wave Model (MFWAM)

## What this model is
The ECMWF Wave Model, commonly referred to as **MFWAM**, is a global wave forecast model that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It is tightly coupled to ECMWF’s atmospheric forecasts and is widely regarded as one of the highest-quality global wave prediction systems.

## Notes
The openly available wave data provides a reduced subset of ECMWF’s full operational wave products, similar in scope to the open IFS atmospheric data.

Despite this reduction, the model is widely used as a reference for global wave forecasting and verification.
