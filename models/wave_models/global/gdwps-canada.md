# GDWPS (Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System)

## What this model is
The Global Deterministic Wave Prediction System (GDWPS) is a global wave forecast model that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It is Canada’s primary operational wave forecasting system and is driven by wind forecasts from Canada’s global atmospheric model.

## Notes
GDWPS is based on the WAVEWATCH III (WW3) model and is closely coupled to Canada’s global atmospheric forecasting system.

It is widely used for marine forecasting in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Arctic regions.
