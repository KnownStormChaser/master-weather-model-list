# GWAM (Global Wave Model)

## What this model is
GWAM is the global wave forecast model operated by the German Weather Service. It predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction for the world’s oceans.

It provides large-scale wave forecasts suitable for open-ocean and long-range marine applications.
