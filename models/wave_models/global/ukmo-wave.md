# UK Met Office Wave Model

## What this model is
The UK Met Office Wave Model is an operational numerical wave forecast system that predicts ocean wave conditions such as significant wave height, wave period, and wave direction.

It is closely coupled with the UK Met Office’s atmospheric forecast models and is used for marine forecasting and safety services.
