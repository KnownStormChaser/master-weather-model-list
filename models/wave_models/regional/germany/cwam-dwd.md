# CWAM (Coastal Wave Model)

## What this model is
CWAM is DWD’s **high-resolution coastal deterministic wave prediction system**, designed for detailed wave forecasting in coastal and near-shore environments.

It provides guidance for marine operations, coastal hazards, and port-scale applications.

---

## Who runs it
- **Organization:** Deutscher Wetterdienst
- **Country / region:** Germany

---

## What area it covers
- **Coverage:** Selected coastal regions, primarily the North Sea and Baltic Sea

---

## Basic details
- **Model type:** Regional deterministic coastal wave model
- **Core wave model:** WAVEWATCH III® (WW3)
- **Horizontal resolution:** ~0.025°–0.05° (domain-dependent)
- **Forecast length:** Up to 78 hours
- **Update frequency:** 2× daily

---

## Forcing and nesting
- **Atmospheric forcing:** ICON-EU or ICON-D2 winds (domain-dependent)
- **Nested inside:** EWAM

---

## What it provides
High-resolution coastal wave forecasts including:
- significant wave height
- wave period and direction
- near-shore wave characteristics relevant for ports and coastal zones

---

## Data availability
- **Is the data free?** Yes
- **Is the data downloadable?** Yes
- **Data formats:** GRIB2
- **Official download location:**
