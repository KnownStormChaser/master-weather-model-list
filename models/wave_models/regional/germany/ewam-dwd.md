# EWAM (European Wave Model)

## What this model is
EWAM is a **regional deterministic wave prediction model** operated by the German Weather Service (DWD), focused on European seas.

It refines global wave forecasts for regional marine forecasting and acts as an intermediate nest between global and coastal wave models.
