# Templates

These templates are here to make adding new model entries fast and consistent.

How to use:
1. Copy the right template file.
2. Rename it to the model name (e.g. `gfs.md`, `gefs.md`, `ukmo-wave.md`).
3. Fill in all fields you can verify from official documentation.
4. If a field is unknown, leave `TBD` (do not guess).
5. Prefer official docs for: resolution, vertical levels, run frequency, forecast length, and download format.

Tips:
- If the model is part of a family (e.g., ICON vs ICON-EPS, IFS vs EPS), add a short note in **Notes**.
- If there are multiple domains (e.g., several coastal wave domains), make separate entries unless the operator treats them as a single product.
- If the public data is a subset of the full operational model, mention that under **Notes**.
